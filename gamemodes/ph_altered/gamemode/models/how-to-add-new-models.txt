replacing something with a different name (e.g. the name of your addon, your name, etc)

in something.lua list your models in the form

    addModel("name", "sex", "team")

name is the name of the model (generally the name in the model's lua file)
sex is gender for taunts (male or female)
team is the team the model will be used in (hunters, props or both)

examples

    addModel("Boxman", "male", "props")
    addModel("Tron Anon", "male", "hunters")


To remove all default player models, in something.lua you can put on the first line

    removeBasicDefaultModels()

Or you can remove them one by one using

    removeModel("name")
